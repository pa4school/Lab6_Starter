## Description

This lab is an assignment for CSE 110 that introduces me to some advanced aspects of JavaScript, web components, and localStorage API. In this lab, I practiced how to create custom elements using JavaScript classes and the Shadow DOM, and how to store and retrieve data from local storage. I also learned how to use a form to add new data to local storage and update the web components accordingly.

The lab has three parts: Expose, Explore, and Expand. In the Expose part, I created custom web components that display recipe cards from local storage. In the Explore part, I added functionality to the form so that I can add new recipes or clear all recipes from local storage. In the Expand part, I experimented with some other technologies that I didn't have time to make a whole lab on, such as lit.dev, React, and CSS variables.

To do this lab, I needed to have Visual Studio Code installed on my computer and a GitHub account. I also needed to install the Live Server extension for VSCode to run the web page locally. I followed the instructions on the web page context to create the required files and folders for each part of the lab. I also used Chrome DevTools to inspect the custom elements and local storage.

This description summarizes what this project is about and what I did. I had a great learning experience doing this lab üòÅ.
